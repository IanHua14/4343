## AAP-3 video notes

* Breaking programs down to smaller pieces, programs, and problems in order to solve a bigger problem
* Using example of turtle graphics via. Python
* Seen in process
  * Functions
  * Methods
  * Parameters
  * Abstraction
  * A bit of simulation
* Using JES version in order to exhibit the particular behavior
* Jython, used for media computation
* To create a function as a way for higher level abstractions where you group things that you need to do frequently 
* Things you can do with the turtle
  * Move it forward
  * Send the body to a color / change color of turtle
  * Turn it / change direction
* The turtle can be a parameter to a command or an object that receives a method call
* The separation of objects allows you to keep state information and not affect the other properties 
* The separation of an object allows it to contain its own information
* A “thing” containing its own information is another aspect of encapsulation
  * Encapsulation - hide formation by putting it inside of objects
* Clearing the path for the turtle removes certain lines of the turtle and also is able to change the brush size affecting the thickness etc.
* Each turtle is independent which allows it to contain its own information
* Middle points are significant
* The middle point allows it to shift and change direction when it touches the border / corner
* The code in the turtle wants to keep it inside the border
* The code essentially made a routine that runs a simulation that is shown on screen
* The media computation turtle program library gives you a list of all the turtles that are shown inside the border
* Technically creating a world inside a world in order to create multiple amounts of turtles that are shown being formed and doing its thing
* The code for one turtles surpasses the parameter with all of the turtles
* In order to calculate the distance between the turtles and make the not collide, calculate the differences between the x and y coordinates
* Euclidean - difference / distance between two points
* Allowing the turtle to move randomly but not hit each other
* “Artifact” - allowed when turtle does touch each other one will be hidden
* Lines of “code” used
  * (hashtag) new method
  * (hashtag) is t afraid of other t.afraid(other) : true/false
  * (hashtag) hide t , t.hideMe()
  * (hashtag) run again (if enough time has lapsed) t.run again()
* Wrap-up
  * Functions can return values that can be used for other purposes
  * Functions can be used to build (encapsulate) common behavior to facilitate reuse
  * The names of the function become like a mini language to describe the problem
  * Classes can encapsulate data/functions to make your code easier to read
