### 5.5

### Notes
If you use GPL (General Public Licensing) you could be forfeiting your right to charge for your software  
Companies like Qualcomm use this to encourage royalty payments  
It is important to know the type of software that you are copying  
Creative Commons CC0 waives copyright and allows anyone to use it  
Open-source software allows you to use code freely and make other things  
Open source GPL licenses allow people to do almost anything except distributing closed source versions of it.  


### Actions
You can make it creative commons 0 which would mean anyone can use it for most everything  
I added the creative commons zero universal license because I don’t mind other people using my code.

### Notes
PII = Personal Identifiable Information  

Known by everyone: Name, Email, Picture, High School attended, Place of residence.  
Take caution: Birthdate, Place of birth, Address, Phone Number, Drivers License Number  
Keep secret: SSN, Tax records, Passwords, Banking information  

Use multi-factor authentication whenever possible  
Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where only one key is used to encrypt and decrypt information  
Asymmetric cryptography is also known as public-key cryptography, which uses one public key and one private key to encrypt and decrypt.  

### Actions
A PII I have seen on a project is our about pages with information about us  
I feel like PII is fine as long as you limit how much information other people know  
A bad password is something simple like “123” while a good password uses a mix of symbols capital letters and numbers.  
Symmetric encryption is where you have one key that encrypts the message and then have to use the same key to decrypt it  
Asymmetric encryption is where you have a public key so anyone can encrypt a message and a private key where only one person can decrypt a key.  
I am not sure of an example of encryption that we have used in deployment  
I haven’t fallen for any phishing scams, however, there is one where scammers send a message offering something free and when you click the link you get redirected to a page that looks like the official page and when you put in your credentials they get them
